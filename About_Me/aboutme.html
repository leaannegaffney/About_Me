<img src = "images/me.jpg" class = "me" alt = "Picture of Me">

<p> My name is Lea-Anne Gaffney and I am 27 years old. I live in Clonmel, Co 	Tipperary with my mother, stepfather and my dog, Coosie.</p> 

<p>I am currently a student in WIT where I am studying Information Technology. If you had told me 10 years ago that I would be wanting an office job working with computers, I would have laughed in your face but times have changed and it is now extremely well paid work with a shortage of females in the industry.</p>

<p>I have worked at a number of jobs, in many different areas of work including factory work, waitressing, call centres, retail and I am even a qualified chef. My biggest regret in life is not knowing what I wanted to do leaving school because I have wasted too many years trying to find the right career for me. I am now at the age where I would like to buy a home with my other half but I am not in a financial position to do so.</p>

<p> My end goal from this course is to find a stable job that is well paid so I can finally buy my dream home.</p>
