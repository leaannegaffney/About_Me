<p>Here is a list of all the things I love to do in my spare time, which to be honest I don't get a lot of. I am in college Monday to Friday and work Thursday and Friday evenings, Saturdays and Sundays so as you can imagine my weeks are busy!</p>

	<ul class ="hobbies">
		<li>Going for long walks in the woods or up the mountain with my boyfriend and our two dogs</li>
		<li>Chilling at home and watching documentaries and movies on Netflix</li>
		<li>Baking up a storm in the kitchen. Click <a href = "baking.html" target = "_blank">here</a> to see some of my creations.</li>
		<li>Online shopping when my bank balance allows it!</li>
		<li>Adding content to my blog, LouleeBelle. You can see it <a href = "http://louleebelle.com/" target = "_blank">here</a> if you wish.</li>
	</ul>
